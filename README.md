## About Me

Hey there! I'm Antoni, a passionate programmer and a follower of Christ. I'm currently on a journey to master **HolyC** and **Java**, using my skills to create meaningful and fun projects. My faith guides me in everything I do, including my approach to programming and learning.

## What I'm Learning 

- **HolyC**: Delving into the world of low-level programming with TempleOS, a unique operating system built by Terry A. Davis, who dedicated it to God.
- **Java**: Strengthening my understanding of object-oriented programming and building robust, cross-platform applications.



I'd love to connect with others who share my interests in programming and faith. Feel free to reach out!



I'm always looking for ways to grow and learn. If you have feedback, suggestions, or just want to collaborate on a project, I'd love to hear from you!
